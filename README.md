### Kia ora (Hello). I'm a Front-End Developer, Designer, and all round internet fan. 

Pronouns: He/him.

Personal website: [https://jasontcrabtree.com](https://jasontcrabtree.com)

I build websites using React, Gatsby JS, Headless CMS' (Prismic), Modern Responsive CSS, Styled-Components, GitHub, and all hosted on Netlify. 

When building websites, I focus on solid foundations in information architecture, implementing best practice accessibility standards, modern responsive and fluid designs, and performance and security best practices. For exploration and design, I'm a huge fan of using Figma.
